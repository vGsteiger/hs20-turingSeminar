\begin{abstract}
	The contribution of Peter Naur to the programming language Algol 60 and his preliminary work in the field of programming language description was a mile- stone of great importance to the field of computer science and the field of program- ming language design in particular. The simple but powerful Backus-Naur form, an extension of Naur to the already existing Backus form, has shown to be the new standard in language description from its use in the Algol 60 report on. The design and logic behind Algol 60 has proven to be the foundation on which a large sub- set of all programming languages still in use today have been built upon. Naur’s thinking ahead and thinking in larger meta questions rather than small technical- ities has proven to be fundamental for the strength of the Algol based languages. Since the importance of Naur’s work, it is a worthwhile undertaking to restate the most important parts of Naur’s contribution to Algol as well as his influence of the programming languages of the future. This report is aimed at bachelor level students of Computer Science, however, we hope to appeal to a wider audience as well.

\section{Introduction}
The content of this paper will present a fairly detailed review of the development of formal notations of languages. The main focus of the first half of the report will lie in the development leading up to the notation used in the Algol 60 report and the notation used in the report itself. The subsequent parts will follow Naur’s personal development and his further contributions to the topic of formalisation. We will wrap up this report with the impact of Naur and the impact of Algol in particular.

\section{History of Formal Descriptions for Languages}
The goal of defining a language by a formal system of variables and rules to derive the language as been of interest to grammarians and mathematicians since the verge of civilisation. Panini, a Sanskrit philologist and grammarian which has worked be- tween the 6th and 4th century BCE had, according to the biography Panini ?, already described a notation structure for the language of Sanskrit. This is insofar interesting as it shows that the problem of a formal description of a language has existed even long before the topic of computer languages ever was one. The interest in a formal notation of a language in the west was not of general interest until the 20th century. With the advance of an interest in new, artificial languages like Esperanto or Ido and especially the rapid advances in calculating machines and first version of computers. The advance of new technologies posed new challenges in human-machine as well as human-human interactions which first had to be resolved before the underlying technological advances could be made usable for a larger audience than research scientists.

\subsection{Noam Chomsky}
Noam Chomsky, an American linguist teaching at MIT combined the new interest from mathematicians and linguists in his teaching groups. Chomsky gave lecture to infor- mation technology students and combined past research in the topic of string rewriting rules and formalisms to develop his own theory of formal logical systems. His main idea was to define the grammar structure of English as a finite state Markov process. To achieve this idea, \cite{1056813} introduced in his paper \textit{Three Models for Description of Language} a notation for the rewriting of strings according to a grammar. A grammar can be viewed as a machine operating on strings and giving certain output to an input. Chomsky also defined several different distinct grammars which are used in theoretical computer science until today.

The importance of Chomsky’s work can not be understated, even though he was not the original inventor of the idea. He built upon work from other mathematicians as well as computer scientists. Most notably Axel Thue as well as Alan Turing. In perspective of this paper, it is of great importance to understand the concept of phrase-structure grammars, also called context-free grammars.

Chomsky defined a language $L$ as a (finite or infinte) set of sentences of finite length. Furthermore, a string is defined as a concatenation of symbols of an Alphabet $A$. The Alphabet consists of a finite set of terminal symbols. A grammar is then defined as a device that produces all of the strings that are sentences of $L$. A properly formulated grammar should define unambiguously the set of grammatical sentences of the language it represents. This means that a sentence which is clearly part of the language should be handled by the grammar in a fixed and predetermined manner.

A phrase-structure grammar consists of a finite vocabulary $V_p$, a finite set of initial strings$E$ in $V_p$ and a finite set of rules $F$ of the form $X \to Y$ , where $X$ and $Y$ are strings in $V_p$. The rules are interpreted as an instruction to the grammar device where $X$ has to be rewritten by $Y$ . So any $Y_i$ is formed from a $X_i$ by replacement of a single symbol of $X_i$ by some string. A derivable string from this language is a string which can be derived by the rules $F$. A terminal string from this language is a string which is the last line of a derivation where there is no further string to be derived.

An example from Chomsky for a phrase-structure grammar would be the following. $^{\cap}$ is introduced for concatenation and can be replaced by an empty space and \# denominate a metalinguistic symbol to determine the boundaries of the given string:

\begin{align*}
	\sum : \# Sentence \# \\
	F: Sentence \to NP^{\cap}VP \\
	VP \to Verb^{\cap}NP \\
	NP \to the^{\cap}man, the^{\cap}book \\
	Verb \to took
\end{align*}

A derivable and terminal string from this grammar would be "the man took the book".

Interesting in the scope of this report is the elaboration of Chomsky that that a language consisting of basic sentences that are derived from terminal strings of a phrase- structure grammar and a set of optional transformation rules applied on these terminal strings may create a language similar to the modern English. The distinction of generative rules of a grammar and transformational rules, which are applied after generating the language may remind some of the way functions and similar constructs in programming languages work today. The insight of Chomsky provided further researchers as well as people interested in the structure of formal notations an entry point.


\subsection{Backus}
John Backus, an American Computer Scientist who received the ACM Turing award in 1977 for his contribution to the design of practical high-level programming systems and for publication of formal procedures for the specification of programming languages. The latter part is interesting in the scope of this report as Backus built upon the idea of Chomsky and Backus was also one of the more influential computer scientists working on the then newly established programming language international algebraic language (IAL). \cite{Backus1959TheSA} authored the report \textit{The syntax and semantics of the proposed international algebraic language of the Zurich ACM-GAMM Conference} which was the defining paper of the programming language now known as Algol 58 and a direct precursor to Algol 60 to which Peter Naur contributed substantially.

Backus, with the knowledge of the power of phrase-structure grammars, introduced a metalinguistic formulae to formally describe the rules of the IAL programming lan- guage. The formulae could describe the phrase-structure grammars and was a more approachable notation to the idea behind these grammars. The metalinguistic formulae introduced by Backus was a reference language to describe the functions of the lan- guage on a meta level to allow for later hardware implementation to only differ with regards to word length, overflow conditions and the like. The idea was to allow the different stake holders in the development of a programming language to communicate with a common, formal notation. The main goal of the reference language introduced by Backus was to be as precise as possible without seeming out of touch. It may also be noted that Backus only starts using his new notation on page five out of seven. He first describes the language in mostly informal ways before he proceeds to describe it in the new notation. This detail will remain relevant later in the paper as Naur has extensively written on the topic of informal and formal notation.

The syntax of the reference language introduced by Backus was the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sequences of character symbols enclosed in "<>" are metalinguistic variables whose values are strings of symbols,
	\item The marks ":$\equiv$" and "$or$" are metalinguistic connectives,
	\item Any mark that is neither a variable nor a connective denotes itself,
	\item The combination of marks and/or variables signifies the combination of the strings denoted
\end{itemize} 

This is best illustrated by an example. The \_ is introduced for the combination of two marks and\/ or variables and will in the derivation ultimately be replaced by an empty space:
\\
\begin{align*}
	<sentence>:<NP>_<VP> \\
	<VP>:<Verb>_<NP > \\
	<NP>:$the man$ or $the book$ \\
	<Verb>:$took$ \\
\end{align*}

As one may observe, it is the same example used in the previous section and should show the power of the notation. Furthermore, as previously, one possible derivation would be "the man took the book". One notable difference to the notation used by Chomsky is that Backus introduced the mark $or$, however, every string in the Backus notation consisting an $or$ could easily be rewritten into one or more strings without using the connective. It is therefore relevant to note that the notation introduced by Backus is exactly as strong as the phrase-structure grammars. The notation used by Backus was too clumsy and did not catch on to the wider field of computer science and would have almost been forgotten, even though the need for an easily understandable and strong notation was greater than ever.

\section{Main part}

\subsection{The need for a formulae}
Before we talk about the contribution of Peter Naur to the field of programming language description as well as his contribution to compiler designs, I would like to talk about where the need for a formal notation to describe a language comes from. We have seen in the background that the need for a formal description of a language has been established long ago, however, this does not explain the real need for this in the modern times of programming language description. 

A programming language, especially the programming language ALGOL 60, has according to \cite{naur1963documentation} the design to be a vehicle for expressing the process of scientific and engineering calculations and numerical analysis. The actual use of a programming language may be far wider, however, in the core most languages are still equipped for this very basic task. The important part of this is that the programming language has to understandable for both the human as well as the computer. This implies two different approaches to the description of a programming language.

On one hand, a formal definition is important to simplify the process of compiler creation, while at the same time being understandable to the human reader. The philosophies on how formal a programming language should be described differ largely. \cite{naur1982formalization} Himself was of the opinion that an overly formal description of a programming language would hurt rather than improve the language. According to \cite{naur1982formalization}, a formal language is only an extension of the informal language rather than a replacement. This signifies an approach in Naur's personal philosophy that desriptions should be easily understandable and approachable for human readers by also including informal language. 

This still meant that there had to be some sort of formulae to describe the programming language in a formal way enough to prevent issues of clarity or even worse mistakes. The formal notation to describe a programming languages would also be powerful enough to create all strings allowed in the language while not being overly powerful or complicated. The result of this was that the notation would have to be a version of Chomsky's phrase-structure grammar.

\subsection{The biography of Peter Naur}
Peter Naur, born in 1928 to a family of artists and business minded parents, had the early interest involving astronomy. He was allowed to work at the local observatory. Peter Naur published his first scientific paper with 15 and he had attained many technical skills of mathematics early on from professional astronomers which took him on as a young prodigy. After finishing his astronomy degree in Copenhagen he was recommended to conduct research at King's college, Cambridge where he focused of astronomy and the emerging field of computer science. Due to weather constraints Naur had to divert his time from astronomy and had more time to spend programming the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). Peter Naur, used to do complicated computational calculations by hand focused his energy mostly on the limitations of the EDSAC such as the limited number range. After leaving Combridge, Naur conducted research at Harvard University and Princeton, where he learned the state of the art in computing. The now more established field of computer science would be the focus of Naur, who returned to Denmark in 1953.

He joined the computer center of Copenhagen and was asked to participate in the development of an algorithmic programming language, later called ALGOL. In the beginning he mostly focused on the highly influental Zurich report of 1958 which lay the ground work for ALGOL. Naur, a very pragmatic computer scientist, was not content with the Zurich report and quickly organized a conference in Copenhagen to discuss the difficulties Naur saw in the Zurich report. After the conference, which did not satisfy Naur entirely, he initialed the ALGOL Bulleting. By editing this discussion journal, Naur became unintentionally the leading European behind the effort to create ALGOL. 

Naurs contribution to ALGOL lay in selecting the right forms of description to define the language. This was in line with his later research as he was more interested in the meta aspects of the language rather than specific implementation. One important piece of this description is the Backus-Naur form named by \cite{knuth-ba} (originally called the Backus normal form). The Backus-Naur form is a metalanguage of metalinguistic formulas for chomsky context-free grammars. Naur applied the notation proposed by \cite{Backus1959TheSA} and modified it slightly and used it for the important ALGOL 60 report by \cite{10.1093/comjnl/5.4.349}.

Naur also contributed to the establishment of computer science as an academic field in Denmark and he has continued to advocate for an applied form of computer science not only for his students but also for the field in general hereby oposing Dijkstra and Wirth structured programming agenda.
