NOTE — If a syntactic-exception is permitted to be an arbitrary
syntactic-factor, Extended BNF could define a wider class of
languages than the context-free grammars, including attempts
which lead to Russell-like paradoxes, e.g.
xx = "A" - xx;
Is "A" an example of xx? Such licence is undesirable
and the form of a syntactic-exception is therefore restricted
to cases that can be proved to be safe. Thus whereas a
syntactic-factor is in general equivalent to some context-free
grammar, a syntactic-exception is always equivalent to some
regular grammar. It may be shown that the difference between a
context-free grammar and a regular grammar is always another
context-free grammar; hence a syntactic-term (and hence any
grammar defined according to this standard) is equivalent to
some context-free grammar

		A call by name is functionally much like a call by reference, but is slightly different in spirit. Instead of passing the address of a variable as an argument, a language that implements call-by-name (i.e., Algol-60) passes a thunk--a pair of functions that provide read and write access to the variable. In the case of simple variables (i.e., not arrays), call-by-name yields the same results as call-by-reference. When an argument to a function or procedure is an array element, however, its index expression is re-evaluated in the caller's scope every time the parameter is used within the function or procedure. Indeed, the swap example below is perhaps the canonical example of the perils of call-by-name. In fact, with call-by-name it is impossible to implement a "foolproof" version of such a swap function.

		The basic difficulty with call-by-name results from the side effects that assignment via thunk can cause. For example, if an array element is passed as an argument, the precise element of the array being referred to can depend on the state; hence, if the state changes, so does the element being referred to. In the example, both i and a[i] are passed as arguments to the same function; then, when i changes, a[i] refers to a different element of the array from that which was (probably) intended.

Discussion: (3 min)
	Computing Versus Human Thinking (previous discussions)
	To the end!

Conclusion: (1 min)
	Importance of formal notations but with respect to the readability -> formal notation is another way to transfer theories but not the only and far from the best way
	What happened since then?
