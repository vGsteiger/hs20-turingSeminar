Title page: (1 min)
Title, name, date/event

Introduction: (3 min)

	Introduction to Peter Naur and Peter Naur's contribution for which he earned the Turing award:

		For fundamental contributions to programming language design and the definition of Algol 60, to compiler design, and to the art and practice of computer programming.

	Formal notations:
		Need, why where from?

Outline: (1 min)
	Formal notation in Algol 60, compiler design and art and practice of computer programming

Activate Previous Knowledge: (4 min)
	Phrase structure grammars
	Backus Naur form (Tony Hoare)
	Programming languages, natural languages and mathematical languages

--- DONE BEFORE

New Information: (10 min)
	Definition of Algol 60: (3 min)
		Historical context
		Backus Naur form in Algol 60 report
		Impact of formalized notation in Algol 60
		Slide on project!!

	Compiler Design: (3 min)
		Gier Algol Compiler and formalized notation

	Art and practice of computer programming: (4 min)

--- DONE AFTER


Discussion: (3 min)
	Computing Versus Human Thinking (previous discussions)

Conclusion: (1 min)
	Importance of formal notations but with respect to the readability -> formal notation is another way to transfer theories but not the only and far from the best way
	What happened since then?
